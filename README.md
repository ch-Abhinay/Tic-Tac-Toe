# TIC-TAC-TOE
##AIM:
To make a project on TIC-TAC-TOE game using a dataset and making computer to choose the best move.
##DESCRIPTION:
The process of making TIC-TAC-TOE game involves following steps:
###Define the Board: 
Decide on the size of the board (typically 3x3) and create a data structure to represent the board, like a 2D array or a list of lists.
###Display the Board:
Create a function to display the current state of the board to the players after each move. This function will show the board's layout and the Xs and Os that have been placed.
###Player Input: 
Implement a function that takes input from the players. Players should be able to enter the row and column where they want to place their X or O.
###Update the Board: 
After receiving the player's input, update the board with the appropriate symbol (X or O) in the specified position.
###Check for Win or Draw: 
After each move, check if a player has won the game or if the game is a draw. Check for three consecutive symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
###Switch Players:
Implement a mechanism to switch between players after each move. For example, if Player 1 places an X, it should be Player 2's turn to place an O, and vice versa.
###Game Loop:
Create a loop that keeps the game running until it's over. This loop should handle player turns, input validation, checking for a win or draw, and displaying the board.

###End of Game:
Once the game is over (either a player wins or it's a draw), display the result and ask if the players want to play again.

###Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling to handle invalid inputs, such as inputting a position that is already taken or providing non-numeric characters.
##CONCLUSION:
We have successfully developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The project aimed to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for users in the classic 3x3 grid. The game incorporated fundamental concepts of Python programming, such as loops, conditionals, functions, data structures, tkinter GUI, File handling etc.
